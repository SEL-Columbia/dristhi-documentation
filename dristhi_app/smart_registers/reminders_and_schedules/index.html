<p>Reminders and Schedules are generated for various services for ANC and Child services. For example, when a new mother is
registered, the mother is enrolled for the ANC Visits, Hb Tests and TT doses. Similarly, when a new child is registered,
the child is enrolled for various immunizations like BCG, OPV etc.</p>

<p>Some of these reminders are dependent on each other. For example, when the mother does her first ANC Visit, the ANC
visit 1 is fulfilled and then the mother is enrolled for the second ANC visit.</p>

<p>The workflow of the reminders happens as follows. For reminders, let us take ANC Registration as an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>An ANC Registration form is filled and saved</li>
<li>The ziggy on the app creates the corresponding mother entity</li>
<li>The form gets submitted to the server</li>
<li>The server processes the form and creates the corresponding mother entity on the CouchDB</li>
<li>The server then enrols this mother to the list of services like (ANC Visit1, Hb/Test, TT dose)</li>
<li>The reminders are generated at a stipulated time at the server (4 pm. in case of Dristhi)</li>
<li>These reminders are pushed to the app the next time the app syncs with the server</li>
<li>These reminders get displayed in the app with a particular colour which corresponds to how soon is the reminder due</li>
</ul>


<p>The reminders are colour coded as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light Blue &ndash; The reminder is in the early window, which means that it is due but not anytime soon</li>
<li>Dark Blue &ndash; The reminder is in the due window, the due date of the reminder/service is close</li>
<li>Red &ndash; The reminder is in the late window, the due date for the reminder/service is already past</li>
</ul>
